# Chapter-2:  Creating a Hello World App
### What I Learned
I learned how to create a simple Flutter app and understood the basics of Flutter’s structure, including the main() function and runApp() method. This chapter introduced me to the concept of building a widget tree to define the UI.

### Achievement
I built and successfully ran a “Hello World” app on both an emulator and a physical device.
